from the cached snapshot of the original request.

2. **Pagination:** When dealing with large volumes of data, use the `page` and `page_size` parameters to paginate through the content. Be consistent with the `page_size` value when paginating a specific job to ensure accurate page context.

3. **Input validation:** Validate your input parameters before sending a request to prevent issues with invalid input values and improve the overall stability of the service.

4. **Error handling:** Always check the `success` property in the response to verify if the request was successful. If an error occurs, handle it gracefully and use the provided error message to resolve the issue.

5. **Content handling:** Depending on your use case, you might need to process different content types such as HTML, XML, JSON, CSV, PDF, or images. Make sure to handle each content type appropriately and sanitize the content if necessary.

6. **The 'no_strip' parameter:** Use the `no_strip` parameter when the content structure and formatting are critical to the understanding of the information. Otherwise, rely on the default content processing to preserve context and improve readability for ChatGPT.

By adhering to these best practices and understanding the Web Requests plugin's capabilities, you can effectively use it to retrieve and process web content for your ChatGPT projects.

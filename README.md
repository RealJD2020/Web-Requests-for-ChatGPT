## Cache Management

The plugin uses an in-memory cache to store request results and improve response times. The cache is cleaned every 2 minutes, removing items older than 15 minutes. The cache size is limited to 200 items.

## Pagination

The plugin supports pagination to handle large amounts of data. The `page` and `page_size` input parameters control the pagination behavior. The default values are 1 and 10000, respectively.

## Input Validation

The plugin validates input parameters to ensure they are valid and within acceptable ranges. The `validate_input` function checks the input parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the input is valid, along with an error message if the input is invalid.

## Content Handling

The plugin can handle various content types, including HTML, XML, JSON, CSV, PDF, and images. It also supports images and text-based files. The `strip_html` function is used to process HTML content, while other content types are handled by their respective functions.

For images, the plugin returns metadata such as format, size, mode, and image URL. For text-based files, the plugin performs transformations to improve readability.

## Command Line Interface

The plugin provides a user-friendly command line interface that allows you to interact with the server and perform various tasks. The available commands are:

- `stats`: Display server statistics, such as requests per hour, cache stats, and ephemeral user requests.
- `purge cache`: Clear the cache.
- `restart`: Restart the server.
- `quit`: Shut down the server.

To use the command line interface, simply type the desired command and press Enter.

## OpenAPI Specification

The Web Requests plugin is accessible through an OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification, which provides a clear and concise way to describe the API service and its available endpoints. This allows developers to understand and interact with the API more effectively. You can find the OpenAPI specification for the Web Requests plugin [here](./openapi.json).

## Best Practices and Usage

1. **Caching:** To reduce server load and improve response times, the plugin caches request results for 15 minutes. When paginating through large content, use the same `job_id` to retrieve content from the cached snapshot of the original request.

2. **Pagination:** When dealing with large volumes of data, use the `page` and `page_size` parameters to paginate through the content. Be consistent with the `page_size` value when paginating a specific job to ensure accurate page context.

3. **Input validation:** Validate your input parameters before sending a request to prevent issues with invalid input values and improve the overall stability of the service.

4. **Error handling:** Always check the `success` property in the response to verify if the request was successful. If an error occurs, handle it gracefully and use the provided error message to resolve the issue.

5. **Content handling:** Depending on your use case, you might need to process different content types such as HTML, XML, JSON, CSV, PDF, or images. Make sure to handle each content type appropriately and sanitize the content if necessary.

6. **The 'no_strip' parameter:** Use the `no_strip` parameter when the content structure and formatting are critical to the understanding of the information. Otherwise, rely on the default content processing to preserve context and improve readability for ChatGPT.

By adhering to these best practices and understanding the Web Requests plugin's capabilities, you can effectively use it to retrieve and process web content for your ChatGPT projects.
